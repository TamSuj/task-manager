# To-Do List Manager

A simple console-based C++ program that allows users to manage their to-do list by adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, and viewing their current to-do list. The program uses multiple classes, operator overload, and LinkedList

## Features

- Add tasks to your to-do list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- View your entire to-do list along with completion statuses.

## Note
- Since the program is relatively simple, I didn't implement file seperation approach in some of the classes.
